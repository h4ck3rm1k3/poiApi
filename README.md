poiApi
======

Description
-----------
poiApi is an implementation of the [OpenStreetMap API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6) written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as middleware for the [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) web application framework.

Installation
------------
First you need to install express

`npm install express`

go into the node_modules directory in install this application through git

`git clone https://github.com/jimmyrocks/poiApi.git`

You will also need to install a few depencencies, I'll add that information later.

Usage
-----

The idea is that you can connect any OpenStreetMap editor to this API instead of the default OpenStreetMap API.  This API will offer more functionality, such as contributing to a public domain dataset as well as contributing directly to OpenStreetMap.
