#poi-api

##Description

poi-api is an implementation of the [OpenStreetMap API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6) written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as middleware for the [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) web application framework.

##Installation

First you need to install express

`npm install express`

go into the node_modules directory in install this application through git

`git clone https://github.com/nationalparkservice/poi-api.git`

You will also need to install a few depencencies. We will add detailed directions soon.

##Usage

The idea is that you can connect any OpenStreetMap editor to this API instead of the default OpenStreetMap API. This API will offer more functionality, such as the ability to contribute to a public domain dataset and OpenStreetMap at the same time.
